Next, enter the number that is presented in front of the social network that you want to open![12](file:///C:/Users/Кирилл%20Гаранин/Downloads/2024-07-11_14-44-56.png). In my case, it's Yandex. We are waiting for the link to be created. We have a link ready, but don't rush to follow it![Link](file:///C:/Users/Кирилл%20Гаранин/Downloads/2024-07-11_14-47-04.png)! First, open the 'Social Networks'![Social Networks](file:///C:/Users/Кирилл%20Гаранин/Downloads/2024-07-11_14-48-28.png) folder, and look for the folder with the social network that you have selected![Yandex](file:///C:/Users/Кирилл%20Гаранин/Downloads/2024-07-11_14-48-44.png). Open the file .html in the IDE. And then click on the link. Ready!
